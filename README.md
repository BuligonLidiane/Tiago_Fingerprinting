# Fingerprinting
A Python implementation of Clarke and Minella (2006) method of measures the increase in uncertainty when sampling sediment fingerprinting. The full explanation of this method is avaliable in the paper "Evaluating sampling efficiency when estimating sediment source contributions to suspended sediment in rivers by fingerprinting".
